# Simple Linear Regression Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating a simple linear regression analysis on a dataset containing information about years of experience and corresponding salaries. The analysis includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, visualization, interpretation, and suggestions for further analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset ('Salary_Data.csv') consists of 30 observations with two columns: 'YearsExperience' and 'Salary'.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The dataset was imported and divided into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training**:
   - A simple linear regression model was trained using the training data.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model was used to predict salaries for the test set.
   - Predictions were compared with actual salaries to evaluate performance.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Scatter plots were created to visualize relationships between years of experience and salary.
   - Regression lines were plotted to demonstrate model predictions.

5. **Interpretation**:
   - The model predicts salaries based on years of experience reasonably well.
   - A positive correlation between years of experience and salary is observed.

6. **Further Analysis**:
   - Additional evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error or R-squared could provide deeper insights into the model's performance.

## Files
- `Salary_Data.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.
- `Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis.

## Conclusion
The simple linear regression analysis demonstrates the relationship between years of experience and salary. While the model appears adequate, further evaluation and analysis could enhance understanding and predictive accuracy.
